Sometimes I feel like a baker in a competition for the most creative cake: carefully choosing the raw data and how to control size, shape and colours to highlight information in each layer, and then composing a balanced combination of layers to convey a message for the viewer to explore. \n\nBut sometimes it is just easier to go to go to shop and buy a box of cake mix and start from there. Web Map Service (WMS) provides prerendered map tiles at different scales. You can add them as useful background images or as additional information layers to complement other data sources.  \n\nToday I want to show you a minimal example of the use of WMS services within R scripts using the `leaflet` package.\n\n## What is WMS?\n\n**WMS** stands for **Web Map Service** and is a [standard protocol](https://www.ogc.org/standard/wms/){target='exlinks'} developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium in 1999 for serving georeferenced map images over the Internet.[^1]\n\nThis service is based on a server-client connection: the client connects to the server using a specific query structure and the server provides a results. All communication is served through HTTP.\n\n[^1]: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service' target = 'exlinks'>*Web Map Service* in Wikipedia</a>\n\nA WMS serve GIS data as images with *fixed styles* and *quick rendering speeds*, and allows *basic querying, zooming and panning*.[^2]\n\n[^2]: <a href='https://gisgeography.com/web-mapping-services-wms/' target = 'exlinks'>*An Introduction to Web Mapping Services (WMS)* By:\nGISGeography, January 6, 2024</a>\n\n## This is how it's done\n\nShort and sweet in seven (or so) lines of code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(leaflet)\n\nwms_src <- \n  \"https://mapprod2.environment.nsw.gov.au/arcgis/services/UHGC/UHGC/MapServer/WMSServer?\"\nwms_layers <- \"0\"\n\nleaflet() |>\n  setView(lng = 151.21, lat = -33.867, zoom = 13) |>\n  addTiles() |>\n  addWMSTiles(wms_src, \n              layers = wms_layers, \n              options = WMSTileOptions(format = \"image/png\", \n                                       transparent = TRUE))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Step by step guide\n\nOk, that was short and fast! Let's slow down and describe the steps in more detail. This will help you understand the process better and provide more info on how to adapt this example to your needs.\n\nSo what do we actually need to create a dynamic map with R and WMS?\n\nIf you have been paying attention, you might have realised that somebody mention a server-client connection. The WMS server will be our server providing the data and R will be (sort of) the client requesting the data and handling it to create the visual display of the map. \n\n### The client\n\n:::{.aside}\nLeaflet JS <https://leafletjs.com/> is probably the most popular open-source JavaScript library for mobile- and web-friendly interactive maps. With an easy to use and well-documented API, many developers have contributed libraries, modules, plug-ins and interfaces to implement leaflet maps from your favourite programming languages and development platforms. Here we are using the R package <https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/> to integrate these JS functions in R.\n:::\n\nBut actually R is not really a Geographic Information System (or is it?). In order to use geospatial data in R we need some specific libraries. Here we will try to create the most basic map with a minimum number of libraries. So we are going to start by loading this library called `leaflet`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(leaflet)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### The server side of things \n\nNow, we need to find the WMS server. There are so many options out there, you just need to start exploring in your area of interest. For example, if you are in Australia you might have heard of New South Wales' [SEED portal](https://www.seed.nsw.gov.au/) or the Common Wealths' <data.gov.au>. These data repositories contain links to many data sources, some of which are available as WMS layers.\n\nFor example, take a look at this dataset:\n\n- NSW Urban Vegetation Cover to Modified Mesh Block 2016\n  - Provides both an area and percentage of vegetation for city blocks and infrastructure corridors in the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Area as of 2016.\n  - Dataset metadata, description and links from [dataset@seed.nsw.gov.au](https://datasets.seed.nsw.gov.au/dataset/nsw-urban-vegetation-cover-to-modified-mesh-block-2016)\n  - WMS link: https://mapprod2.environment.nsw.gov.au/arcgis/services/UHGC/UHGC/MapServer/WMSServer\n\n### Requesting data from a WMS\n\nThe relevant info here is the **WMS link** that will receive our requests to the server. The first request that we will make is called `GetCapabilities`, for example if you copy this in your browser:\n\n<https://mapprod2.environment.nsw.gov.au/arcgis/services/UHGC/UHGC/MapServer/WMSServer?request=GetCapabilities&service=WMS>{target='exlinks'}\n\n:::{.aside}\nIn this example the browser is our client and the response is like a catalogue of the available functions and layers!\n:::\n\nYou will get a response in xml format. The output might look undecipherable at first, but if you are familiar with xml, you will be able navigate the tags with relevant information. For example we need to locate the queryable layers and find their `Name` tag. In this case if we are interested in the Percent Tree Canopy for 2019, we need the layer with name `0`:\n\n```xml\n...\n<Layer queryable=\"1\">\n<Name>0</Name>\n<Title>\n<![CDATA[ Urban Veg Cover - Percent Tree Canopy 2019 ]]>\n</Title>\n</Abstract>\n...\n```\n\nTo actually get the data we are looking for, we normally have to create a more specific request like `GetMap`. This is where a good client would help us to create that specific request, read the data and provide the extra interactive functionality for zooming and panning. This is usually handled by packages in our Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software.\n\nIn our case, we will let `leaflet` handle this for us, so for now we only need to know the address of the server:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwms_src <- \n  \"https://mapprod2.environment.nsw.gov.au/arcgis/services/UHGC/UHGC/MapServer/WMSServer?\"\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd the name of the layer or layers we are going to use\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwms_layers <- \"0\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Creating Simple Maps with leaflet\n\nWe can create a basic map with R and `leaflet` by concatenating commands using the pipe symbol `|>`. First, initialize the map with `leaflet()`, then define the map view with `setView()`, providing longitude, latitude coordinates, and a zoom level. Then use `addTiles()` to add default background base maps.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleaflet() |>\n  setView(lng = 151.21, lat = -33.867, zoom = 13) |>\n  addTiles() \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-7aca389462f6bcd65d97\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-7aca389462f6bcd65d97\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"setView\":[[-33.867,151.21],13,[]],\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright/\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a>,  <a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\\\">ODbL<\\/a>\"}]}]},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we are ready to add the WMS layers to the leaflet map using the `addWMSTiles()` function and usign the values of the `baseUrl` and `layers` described above. Like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nleaflet() |>\n  setView(lng = 151.21, lat = -33.867, zoom = 13) |>\n  addTiles() |>\n  addWMSTiles(baseUrl = wms_src, \n              layers = wms_layers, \n              options = WMSTileOptions(format = \"image/png\", \n                                       transparent = TRUE))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"leaflet html-widget html-fill-item\" id=\"htmlwidget-118bef477e0f66f63735\" style=\"width:100%;height:464px;\"></div>\n<script type=\"application/json\" data-for=\"htmlwidget-118bef477e0f66f63735\">{\"x\":{\"options\":{\"crs\":{\"crsClass\":\"L.CRS.EPSG3857\",\"code\":null,\"proj4def\":null,\"projectedBounds\":null,\"options\":{}}},\"setView\":[[-33.867,151.21],13,[]],\"calls\":[{\"method\":\"addTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png\",null,null,{\"minZoom\":0,\"maxZoom\":18,\"tileSize\":256,\"subdomains\":\"abc\",\"errorTileUrl\":\"\",\"tms\":false,\"noWrap\":false,\"zoomOffset\":0,\"zoomReverse\":false,\"opacity\":1,\"zIndex\":1,\"detectRetina\":false,\"attribution\":\"&copy; <a href=\\\"https://openstreetmap.org/copyright/\\\">OpenStreetMap<\\/a>,  <a href=\\\"https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/\\\">ODbL<\\/a>\"}]},{\"method\":\"addWMSTiles\",\"args\":[\"https://mapprod2.environment.nsw.gov.au/arcgis/services/UHGC/UHGC/MapServer/WMSServer?\",null,null,{\"styles\":\"\",\"format\":\"image/png\",\"transparent\":true,\"version\":\"1.1.1\",\"layers\":\"0\"}]}]},\"evals\":[],\"jsHooks\":[]}</script>\n```\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are much more things you can do with WMS in R[^3], but this simple approach is very useful as a starting point for most common examples.\n\n[^3]: See for example: [Using WMS services in R](https://inbo.github.io/tutorials/tutorials/spatial_wms_services/) by Thierry Onkelinx - INBO Tutorials.\n\n### Where is the data?\n\nWhen you work with WMS layers, you do not have direct access to the GIS database (vector features or raster bands), but rather to a pre-rendered image or product derived from such data. We do not download anything, it is all provided by a server and processed by a client.\n\n### Ok, but what is the legend for that layer?\n\nGood question, you can get a legend from the WMS using another request: `GetLegendGraphic`. So you can build a request like this:\n\n<https://mapprod2.environment.nsw.gov.au/arcgis1041/services/UHGC/UHGC/MapServer/WmsServer?request=GetLegendGraphic%26version=1.3.0%26format=image/png%26layer=0> \n\nand you will get a graphic like this: \n\n<img src='https://mapprod2.environment.nsw.gov.au/arcgis1041/services/UHGC/UHGC/MapServer/WmsServer?request=GetLegendGraphic%26version=1.3.0%26format=image/png%26layer=0'/>\n\nIt would be nice to embed this legend in the map, right? I will come back to that in another post...\n\n## Conclusion\n\nMaking feature rich dynamic maps with R, leaflet and WMS services is a piece of cake!\n\nHere the basic recipe:\n\n- Find the WMS server,\n- Identify the layer of interest,\n- Build your WMS request, \n- Add the layer to your map,\n- Enjoy! \n\nNow is time for you to explore different WMS sources and enhance your spatial projects by reusing existing layers to create captivating visualizations.\n\n",
