This is the typical `Hello World!` post in my new and wonderful blog. Welcome!

So this is basically here to test if the whole thing works.

To get started I first installed quarto.[Well to be honest, it all started with a operating system, then installing lots of packages, and R and Python, and ... but let's keep it short.]

Then, once I decided how to name my blog, I ran:

```sh
quarto create project blog spatial-one
```

Then I started to prepare the content and structure of my initial posts, modified the text in the `qmd` files and the configuration in the `_quarto.yml` and ran 

I started to keep track of changes with git...

```sh
cd spatial-one
git init
```

I switch between VS-code, Rstudio and the terminal to organise my files, and kept working on this until I got something I wanted to preview:

```sh
quarto preview spatial-one
```

Here some random notes about the process

## icons

For some reason I though these would fontsawesome icons, but the help prompt in VS-code pointed out:

> Name of bootstrap icon (e.g. github, twitter, share). See https://icons.getbootstrap.com/ for a list of available icons
